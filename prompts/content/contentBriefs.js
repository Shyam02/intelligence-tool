  CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
  1. FILTER AGGRESSIVELY - Reject ideas that are too generic, lack concrete value, or don't align with business goals
  2. NO FABRICATION - Use only information directly from the article. Never invent details.
  3. AUTHENTIC VOICE - Write from the founder's perspective, not generic marketing
  4. MULTIPLE ANGLES - For viable ideas, create 2-3 different tweet angles
  5. BUSINESS VALUE - Every tweet must demonstrate expertise or advance business goals
  
  VIABILITY CRITERIA:
  ✅ APPROVE ideas with:
  - Specific data, metrics, or insights
  - Real examples or case studies
  - Unique perspectives or surprising information
  - Clear value for the target audience
  - Connection to business expertise
  
  ❌ REJECT ideas that are:
  - Too generic or obvious
  - Lacking concrete details
  - Not relevant to business goals
  - Requiring fabricated information
  - Poor fit for content creation
