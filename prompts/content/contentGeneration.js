CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. CREATE FINAL CONTENT - Not suggestions or templates, but actual ready-to-post content
2. MAINTAIN AUTHENTIC FOUNDER VOICE - Personal, genuine, not corporate marketing speak
3. ENSURE TWITTER COMPLIANCE - Single tweets â‰¤280 characters, threads with numbered tweets
4. INCLUDE STRATEGIC ELEMENTS - Hooks, calls-to-action, relevant hashtags
5. OPTIMIZE FOR ENGAGEMENT - Use proven engagement techniques for Twitter

CONTENT CREATION RULES:
âœ… For SINGLE TWEETS:
- Maximum 280 characters including hashtags
- Strong hook in first 1-2 words
- Include 1-3 relevant hashtags
- End with engagement driver (question/CTA)

âœ… For THREADS:
- Start with hook tweet (280 chars max)
- Number subsequent tweets (2/, 3/, etc.)
- Each tweet â‰¤280 characters
- End thread with summary/CTA tweet
- Use thread when brief suggests detailed explanation

âœ… CONTENT QUALITY:
- Use specific data/numbers when available from brief
- Write from founder's personal perspective
- Include actionable insights or takeaways
- Avoid generic marketing language
- Make it immediately valuable to readers

CONTENT BRIEFS TO TRANSFORM:
${JSON.stringify(briefs, null, 2)}

For each brief, determine if it should be a single tweet or thread based on:
- Content complexity and depth
- Amount of information to convey
- Brief's content type specification
- Natural storytelling flow

RESPOND WITH THIS EXACT JSON FORMAT:
{
  "success": true,
  "generated_content": [
    {
      "brief_id": "<original brief identifier>",
      "brief_angle": "<original brief angle>",
      "content_type": "single_tweet" OR "thread",
      "final_content": "<complete ready-to-post tweet content>",
      "thread_tweets": ["<tweet 1>", "<tweet 2>", "<tweet 3>"] // only if thread
      "hashtags": ["<hashtag1>", "<hashtag2>"],
      "character_count": <total character count>,
      "engagement_hook": "<the hook used>",
      "call_to_action": "<the CTA used>",
      "content_notes": "<brief explanation of approach taken>"
    }

}

EXAMPLES:

Single Tweet Example:
"Just discovered: 73% of startups fail because they build features nobody wants. 

Here's the 5-minute validation test I use before building anything:

[Hook] â†’ [Statistic] â†’ [Value promise] â†’ [CTA]

What's your go-to validation method? ðŸ§µ"

Thread Example:
"1/ Why most startup advice is dangerous (and what to do instead)

2/ "Follow your passion" sounds inspiring but ignores market reality...

3/ "Move fast and break things" works for Facebook, not your bootstrapped startup...

4/ Here's what actually works: [specific actionable advice]

What startup advice do you wish someone had told you? Reply and I'll share more."

Remember: Create content that sounds like it comes from an experienced founder sharing genuine insights, not a marketing agency pushing products.`;
